    "# Module 2 — Lab 2: Customer Data Quality Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lab 2: __Customer Data Quality Engine__, you will build a small Python program that checks the quality of customer address records and generates a simple text-based report. The lab is designed to strengthen your __algorithm__, __data structure__, and __class/function__ design skills, using a realistic “data engineering” style problem: validating and maintaining customer data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Please carefully read instructions for each step to understand tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**You will learn:**\n",
    "1. Core data structures in practice: list, dict, set, deque, heap\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Core algorithms in practice: scanning, grouping, sorting, top-K selection, event processing\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Class + function design: building clean reusable methods instead of messy scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data engineering mindset: validating data, building indexes, generating quality reports, and handling updates like a pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the lab, you will have a working “quality engine” that can detect missing information, prioritize the worst records, and update customer data efficiently—using fundamental CS skills that appear in real data systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python 3.10+\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab (or VS Code notebooks)"
