    "# Module 1 — Lab 1 (Python Only): Build a Customer Data Cleaning Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to your first programming lab! You will build a notebook that reads customers.csv, performs data profiling and quality checks, cleans key fields, builds a current customer snapshot (one row per customer), then exports:\n",
    "1. reports/quality_report.md\n",
    "2. data/processed/customers_current.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Please carefully read instructions for each step to understand tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**You will learn:**\n",
    "1. Data ingestion: load a real CSV dataset correctly and inspect its schema (columns, types, size).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data profiling: quickly understand the dataset using summaries (missing values, duplicates, distributions).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Data quality thinking: define simple validation rules (e.g., required fields, valid ranges, allowed categories) and measure how many records violate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data cleaning & standardization: fix messy real-world fields (timestamps, postcode/ZIP formats, tax IDs, whitespace) into consistent formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Record consolidation: handle duplicate keys by building a current customer snapshot (one row per customer using “latest/current” logic).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Data publishing: export cleaned outputs and produce a short quality report—a mini version of a production pipeline deliverable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python 3.10+\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab (or VS Code notebooks)"
